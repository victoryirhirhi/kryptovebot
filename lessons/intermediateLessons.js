  **What is Technical Analysis (TA)?**
  Technical Analysis is the study of market data, mainly price and volume, to forecast future price movements.  
  Unlike Fundamental Analysis (which looks at project value), TA focuses on patterns, indicators, and market psychology.
  
  **Key Principles**
  - Market action discounts everything (price reflects all info).
  - Prices move in trends (up, down, sideways).
  - History repeats itself (human behavior is predictable in markets).
  
  **Common Tools**
  - Candlestick charts
  - Support and resistance levels
  - Trendlines
  
  ðŸ“Œ **Exercise**
  - Open TradingView.
  - Draw trendlines on BTC/USDT daily chart.

  - Balance between BTC, ETH, altcoins, and stablecoins.
  
  **Risk-to-Reward (R:R)**
